    <h1><u>More than just punches</u></h1>
    <p>So in normal bullying one can be punched,threated,name called,humilliated.Not in kdrames where a chair is thrown,people fly towards you or water buckets that is just too much.</p>
    <p><u>Types of 'normal' bullying are;</u> </p>
    <p><u>Physical</u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>hitting </li>
        <li>pushing</li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>Verbal</u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>name calling</li>
        <li>insults</li>
        <li>threats</li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>cyber</u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>posting hurtful messeges</li>
        <li>creating fake accounts to target someone e.g. body shaming</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The thing is in Africa,specifically Zimbabwe,specifically Bulawayo.If you bully someone two things can happen they jump you at some point or they are affected.Now when I say they jump you, I mean at some point they will find you and hit normally with a gang of people.So don`t bully people.Now its not like people are bullet proof or anything and if you bully someone and they don`t clap back,well that just means you have become the source of thier misery <a href="effects.html">Effects</a></p>
